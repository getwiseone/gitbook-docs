# A Personal Manifesto

I am often wrong about the true causes of my own behavior. Watch me now- “evolved, determined, authentic, and resonant”, “signaling, saturated in privilege.”

## Evolution

True this about life: **traits enhancing survival and reproduction** become more common in successive generations of a population.

* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour \(phenotypic variation\)
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction \(differential fitness\)
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation \(heritability of fitness\)

_First-person experiences, the mental dispositions of a modular brain are the product of this process \(like all aspects of the organism\) and should be considered for their lineage._

## It is Determined

True this about everything: **determinism and dependent origination**, is cause and effect, and is chaos theory, and is time as a dimension.

* Nothing exists without cause and conditions \(determinism\)
* No causes could have been otherwise \(dependent origination means unity\) 

## The Actualizing Tendency \(The Universal Will\)

Witness: There is **a directional trend evident in all organic and human life**: it is the urge to expand, develop, and mature; it is the tendency to express and activate all the capacities of the organism and the self. \(The Universal Will\)

## Flourishing

Witness: A good life is **a first person experience that is resonant with this actualizing tendency**, as the expansion, development, and maturity of one’s life; an expression and activation of all capacities. \(Opposed to an experience that is dissonant, “out of tune.”\) 

* Flourishing is “living within an optimal range of human functioning, one that connotes goodness, generativity, growth, and resilience”
* Flourishing is “the opposite of both pathology and languishing, which are described as living a life that feels hollow and empty.”

### Be

When being an operator, "you act." There are things that can be impacted by your actions, and things that can not. Know the difference.

When transcendent, "you are." Behavior is determined first, then observed.

The Will to Life - it is individual and collective and descendent- it is food, fuck and fight/flight

The Will to Self

The Will to Power  


Personal Health- In the service of the will… \(the will to survival\)   


The will to self... survive is primary.

All motives can be mapped to self survival and reproduction. Positive social engagement is advantageous to survival and reproduction.  
  
  


Tenets of a Good Perspective 

* What people do is determined by causes and conditions, momentum and tendencies. We are each the product of our own circumstances.
* You share the world with other persons who do not share your circumstances. This is out of your control. This is out of their control.
* Therefore: moderate praise and blame
* 
Darryl’s threat theory: we are physiologically built to build metal perspectives based on perceived threats. Threats are circumstantial. This informs everything,

“The Will” is as everything does. It is unified. It the first cause giving momentum to the last cause.  


The actualizing tendency is a striving, so strive for:

* The fullest expression of your personal capabilities. \(do art and music, design and deploy digital tools for engagement, write words of reason, learn more, lead, control yourself and your environment- be healthy, fit, and strong\)
  * The Objective: wealth and health
  * The Subjective: mental and social
  * Self and others 
* The fullest expression of your social capabilities. \(educate, inspire, lead\)
* The fullest expression of your communal capabilities. \(support flourishing, raise children to be great\)

Self-actualize.  
  


\(Should you care about things you cannot control?\)  
  


...Belief in the actualising tendency – a fundamental motivation towards growth. Rogers, the originator of the concept, describes it as:

‘…man’s tendency to actualize himself, to become potentialities. By this I mean the directional trend which is evident in all organic and human life – the urge to expand, develop, mature – the tendency to express and activate all the capacities of the organism and the self. This tendency may become deeply buried under layer after layer of encrusted psychological defences; it may be hidden behind elaborate facades that deny its existence; it is my belief, however, based on my experience, that it exists in every individual, and awaits only the proper conditions to be released and expressed’.

“True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.” - Seneca

### Social well-being

A personal theory of ethics and politics can be evaluated in the context of actualization viz Social Well-being.  


A good and correct system \(from highlights below\):

* Social Integration - Feel a part of society, have something in common with others who constitute their social reality.
* Social Acceptance - Trust others, think that others are capable of kindness, and believe that people can be industrious. Hold favorable views of human nature and feel comfortable with others.
* Social Contribution - Feel that whatever you do in the world is valued by society and contributes to the commonwealth
* Social Actualization - hopeful about the condition and future of society, and recognize society’s potential
* Social Coherence - Feel that you understand what is happening around you 

Sources:

Social well-being is the appraisal of one’s circumstance and functioning in society. Among the potential benefits of public life are social integration and cohesion, a sense of belonging and interdependence, and a sense of shared consciousness and collective fate.

#### Social integration

Social integration is the evaluation of the quality of one's relationship to society and community. Healthy individuals feel that they are a part of society. Integration is therefore the extent to which people feel they have something in common with others who constitute their social reality \(e.g., their neighborhood\), as well as the degree to which they feel that they belong to their communities and society. Social integration draws on conceptions of social cohesion \(Durkheim\), cultural estrangement and social isolation \(Seeman\), and class consciousness \(Marx\). In Durkheim's view, social coordination and health reflect individuals' connections to each other through norms and indicate their fondness for society. According to Seeman \(1959, 1983, 1991; also see Merton 1949\), cultural estrangement is the cleavage of self from society. Estrangement is the rejection of society or the realization that society does not reflect one's own values and lifestyle. Social isolation is the breakdown of personal relationships that provide meaning and support. Like Marx's conception of class consciousness, social integration entails the construal of collective membership and fate. 

#### Social acceptance

Social acceptance is the construal of society through the character and qualities of other people as a generalized category. Individuals who illustrate social acceptance trust others, think that others are capable of kindness, and believe that people can be industrious. Socially accepting people hold favorable views of human nature \(see Wrightsman 1991\) and feel comfortable with others \(Horney 1945\). Social acceptance is the social analogue to personal acceptance: People who feel good about their personalities and accept both the good and the bad aspects of their lives exemplify good mental health \(Fey 1955; Ryff 1989\). Therefore social acceptance of others might be the social counterpart to self-acceptance.

#### Social contribution

Social contribution is the evaluation of one's social value. It includes the belief that one is a vital member of society, with something of value to give to the world. Social contribution resembles the concepts of efficacy and responsibility. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can perform certain behaviors \(Bandura 1977\) and can accomplish specific objectives \(Gecas 1989\). Social responsibility is the designation of personal obligations that ostensibly contribute to society. Social contribution reflects whether, and to what degree, people feel that whatever they do in the world is valued by society and contributes to the commonwealth. This construct is consistent with Marx's thesis that people are naturally productive \(Israel 1971\). Alienation is the economic counterpart to the diminution of the perceived value of one's life and everyday activities. The developmental analogue of social contribution is generative motives and behavior. Midlife, according to Erikson \(1950\), is a period when adults can act on their desire to contribute to society by molding the next generation into productive members of society \(for example, by mentoring\).

#### Social actualization

Social actualization is the evaluation of the potential and the trajectory of society. This is the belief in the evolution of society and the sense that society has potential which is being realized through its institutions and citizens. Healthier people are hopeful about the condition and future of society, and they can recognize society's potential. Socially healthier people can envision that they, and people like them, are potential beneficiaries of social growth. The evaluation of social progress is consistent with Sroles \(1956\) interpretation of anomie as the evaluation of society's potential by the evaluation of the character of society's custodians \(for example, public officials\). Similarly, social actualization resembles fatalism \(Lefcourt 1982\) and powerlessness \(Seeman 1991\). Parallel to self-determination, social actualization is the sense that society controls its destiny. The focus on the realization of social potential also is similar to the theme of potential and its development as self-realization \(Maslow 1968\), eudaimonic happiness \(Waterman 1993\), and personal growth \(Ryff 1989\). Optimal functioning, in part, is openness to experience and the desire and effort to grow continually. Social actualization captures these ideas of growth and development.

#### Social coherence

Social coherence is the perception of the quality, organization, and operation of the social world, and it includes a concern for knowing about the world. Healthier people not only care about the kind of world in which they live, but also feel that they can understand what is happening around them. Such people do not delude themselves that they live in a perfect world; they have maintained or promoted the desire to make sense of life. Social coherence is analogous to meaninglessness in life \(Mirowsky and Ross 1989; Seeman 1959, 1991\), and involves appraisals that society is discernable, sensible, and predictable. Psychologically, healthier individuals see their personal lives as meaningful and coherent \(Ryff 1989\). The sense of personal coherence, according to Antonovsky \(1994\), may be a marker of health: individuals who have coherence attempt to maintain coherence when faced with unpredictable and traumatic life events.
