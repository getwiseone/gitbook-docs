# What is wise.one?

**A problem worth solving.** Consumers want to be heard by decision makers in a wide variety of contexts \(from policy-making to brand-building\) but standard ad hoc polling methods are cumbersome and generally unsatisfying for the particpants. On the other side, analysts want to collect polling data for advanced segmentation and modeling, but have limited time and few resources to invest in conducting these surveys.

**Our solution:** Wise.one invested in three key areas: 1\) a rewarding participant experience, 2\) analyst-friendly access to comprehensive \(anonymized\) datasets for offline analysis, and 3\) meaningful insights provided though a standardized reporting pipeline.

**Sales channels:** Wise.one will sell data products -- downloadable datasets and online access to reports -- through the official wise.one website and mobile app \(using Stripe\). Sales agents will work with enterprise prospects to develop larger support contracts.

**Marketing activities:** Wise.one will launch with public polling programs \(e.g. the Happiness Survey\) to frame publicity efforts and demonstrate capabilities. The resulting datasets and reports will be public and free, drawing analysts into the acquisition pipeline.
